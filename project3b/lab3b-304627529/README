My uid is 304627529

The shell command to execute my program is "python lab3b.py".

My source code is in lab3b.py.

My Makefile has:
	run - It just executes "python lab3b.py" which produces lab3b_check.txt.
	check - It was used by me to test my txt file. It compares it with the sample.
	clean - It deletes lab3b_check.txt
	dist - It creates a tarball with the source code, Makefile, and README

My README is this file, it contains my uid, shell command to execute my program, and
a description of everything inside my tarball.

As far as I know of, my program has no limitations, but I didn't get to test double
and triple indirect blocks.
