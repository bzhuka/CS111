My project contains lab3a.c which is a C source module that compiles
cleanly with no errors or warnings, a Makefile which is used to
build the program and the tarball, and a README which describes
the included files.

I tested my program by comparing my outputs with the sample csv files
while using the same disk-image.  They are the same.
