My project contains server.c, client.c, Makefile, my.key, and README.

My two C source modules compile cleanly to executables client and server.  My
client acts like a shell, but all it does is send things to the server.  My
server has two threads and a forked process and sends things to the forked
process that is running /bin/bash using the two threads like project 1a.

My Makefile has a make option, can make the executables individually, can
make clean, and can make dist.

My key is just random characters.

My README is this.
